this is the backend for the plan my weekend project
here's the deployed site: https://plan-my-weekend.netlify.app

the website plans an epic weekend itinerary for the city of your choice
i used Metaphor's API to get real-time data about what's happening in the city from the internet
i then sent that data to OpenAI's API to plan an weekend itinerary

if you have any questions, feel free to send me an email: kieran.hulsman@uwaterloo.ca

please enjoy!
