# README
this is the backend for the plan my weekend project
here's the deployed site: https://plan-my-weekend.netlify.app
here's the front end: https://github.com/kieran-hulsman/plan-my-weekend-frontend

the website plans an epic weekend itinerary for the city of your choice
i used Metaphor's API to get real-time data about what's happening in the city from the internet
i then sent that data to OpenAI's API to plan an weekend itinerary

i deployed the backend with Render, and the frontend with Netlify

if you have any questions, feel free to send me an email: kieran.hulsman@uwaterloo.ca
